Hello World! It is Martin the Lovely Hamster here!

I got inspired to start this blog to keep track of my learning progression of Machine Learning.
But I decided that I will be using this platform to share what I'm learning in general, not just related to computer science. 
Whether that be an online course on biology, about volleyball, swimming, or lovely hamsters. 

I hope you decide to follow along my journey and learn some new things as well!

Happy learning! *hamster noises*
