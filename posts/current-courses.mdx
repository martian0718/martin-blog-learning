# Coursera Courses

I'm currently taking 2 Courses with one of them belonging to a specialization. 
- [The Science of Stem Cells](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stem-cells/home/week/2)
- [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/home/week/2)


## The Science of Stem Cells

This is a small course by the American Museum of Natural History which goes into detail on what a stem cell is and the potential that it has in the realm of medicine.
It is a free and short five week asynchronous course. I will leave a review once I'm completed with it!


## The Data Scientist's Toolbox

The Data Scientist's Toolbox is part of John Hopkin's [Data Science: Foundation using R specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r)
which in turn is foundation for the [Data Science and Machine Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-statistics-machine-learning). 
I hope to follow this track to expand my knowledge in the realm of machine learning. It is a very short course introducing developer tools and R to the new developer.



Happy learning! *hamster noises* ü§ìüêπ
